# GIT Tutorial

## The Terminology of GIT
git is a Command Line Interface (CLI) software that can be installed and used locally (offline), used for the VCS (Version Control System) which track the files and the changes done to them.

## Changing the files from the Git and update them on Github
1. after linking the Git to your Github we can view and edit the files.
1. after applying the changes we enter the command (git add .) to add all the files with the changes.
1. then the command (git commit m- "") to write a commit about the changes we did.
1. finally, the command (git push origin main) to update the changes to your Github.
