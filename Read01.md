this document is to summarize what i learned about github pages and the markdown.

## Mastering Markdown
Markdown is used to style web texts, it uses symbols instead of tags unlike html to change the text boldness, document display and adding images.
the mark down have two extensions `.md` or `.markdown`

### the common symbols that are used in markdown are:
- `* *` star quotation to make the words in Italic
       *(Italic)*
- `** **` double star quotation to make the words in Bold
        **(Bold)**
- `#` hashtag represent the header (more hastags makes a smaller header)

- `-` single hyphen for unordered list
          
- `1.` for ordered list

- `[]()` square braket+round brackets for adding links

## Github Pages
This feature in Github allows you to select a theme for your repositories and preview it as a website after generating a shareable link for it.
without the knowledge in html, github allows you to create websites related to your personal account to showcase your portfolio, project or homeworks.
