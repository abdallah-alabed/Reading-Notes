### the main key principles for a good wireframe
* simplicity  
* clarity
* confidence 

## HTML
Hypertext Markdown Language, Tells the browser what the content is:
* Text
* Link
* Image
* Headline

HTML communicates and organizes how the content should be organized using tags depend on the level of importance and how to display them in boxes.

## semantics 
the meaning of a piece of code.

HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.
### the difference between syntax and semantics

|Syntax|Semantics|
|-----|-----|
| how to write something | what do they mean |
