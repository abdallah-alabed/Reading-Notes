# Introduction
In todays read we are going to talk about Javascript (JS)

## what is Javascript
Compiled programming language and it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, helps with the functionality of the website.

### How can we link our JS to the HTML
* Inline script : where we write the JS code inside the HTML file.
* External file : adding an Externalfile to the html file using the command <script src="app.js"> for example.

### Javascript Variables 
Can be declared using the command "var"

ex: "var x = 69"

These variables can be assigned to different data types:
* numbers :1  -676 1.637
* strings : "anything that can be typed"
* boolean : true or false
* operators : Arithmatic "+ , - , / , * "

* comparison : < , > , = , <= , != ...
* assignment operator : = only

### pop boxes
We can use either:
* alert (okay or cancel)(no typing from the user side)
* prompt (type + okay or cancel)
* confirm (display info with okay only)

### Conditional statement
syntax : if (condition){perform if yes}

  else {perform if no}

  > we can do nested loops using "if + else if + else"
