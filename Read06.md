# Introduction 
In todays' read we will talk about CSS what it, why we need it and how is it implimented in our system.

## What is CSS?
cascading style sheets, uses a simple syntx so we can style our webpages.

## Why we need CSS?
we can style our webpages using css to position the elements, change font, background colors,etc., in other words creating a more user friendly website.

## How can we add it?
CSS can be linked with the html in 3 ways:

1.  inline style: we style the element inside the tagg itself.
> example <p style="color:black"> .

1. internal style: we style in the head tag.
1. external style: create an external css file and write the styling in it.
>should be linked in the beginning of the code so the styling can take actions immediately using the command <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">.
