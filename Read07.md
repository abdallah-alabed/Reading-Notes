# Introduction
In todays read we are going to talk about programming using Javascript (JS)

## Functions
one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript,it is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value and should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output then it get called when needed.
### Why we use Functions
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
### the syntax
#### how to write the function:
> EX: function FunName(parameter) {
  return number * number;
}

> we call the function with the name only "FunName(5);"


### Methods of writing a function
1. **Function decleration** : *we write the function separetly then call it whe we need it*
1. **Function expression** : *write the function inside a variable then we  call the variable when ever we need the function *
> note that the second method is less common as we cant we use the function before we declare it (write the function then call it) which is possible with the first method.

### Control Flow
the function writing methods lead us to talk about the sequence of how the computer executes the script.
> Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
