**can be added to HTML in 3 ways**

1. inline 
2. internal linking
> create a section in the head called style
   
   > where we mention the tags we want to modify and do the mods.

3. external linking
> after creating all the customizations on a separate css file we link it using the following command <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" ...>

## Why  we use external CSS more frequent?
- use the principle of separation of concerns, this makes both the HTML and CSS easier to read and more organized
- can be used on multiple HTML documents without having to rewrite CSS declarations
- allow global styles to be changed easily, new changes will be applied to the entire HTML document the external CSS is used on
