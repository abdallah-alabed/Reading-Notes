### lists
we have 3 types of lists:

1. Ordered Lists: each item begin with a number. 
2. Unordered Lists: each item begin with a bullet. 
3. Definition Lists:separated into two parts the term and the definition and its used to show the definition of a term in a more organized way.

the following examples represent the three list types respectively:

> we can create nested lists by creating a list inside an existing list item.

### Some CSS features
1. altering and limiting the dimensions (width, height)
2. deal with overflow content
3. adjust borders (width, style, color, shape ....)
> borders are what separates the edges of two boxes from each other.
4. adjust padding
> padding is the space between the element content and the border. 
5. adjust margins
> margin is the space around the element.
6. boxes visibility


### inline and block items
we can change the property of the elements from block to inline using the command display.

### loops 
- switch
> syntax: switch(LOL){
  LOL=case one ,,, do something ...
}

- if else 
> if (LOL==7){do something} else{do something}

- for 
> for (i=0,i<=5,i++){do something}

- while
> while (i>=5){do something}

- do while
>do{ something }while()

***- we use for loop when we know the number of iterations***

***- notice how in do-while we execute one time before we check the condition***
