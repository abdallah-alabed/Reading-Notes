## Layout
***tips to build a proper looking website:***
- the use of block and inline elements (what requires a full block and what not)
- containing elements (make sure no element is covering another element)
- positioning of elements (control the layout of the page so we can match the wireframe we sketched)
- float (setting elements to far edges)(we can create multi-columns)
- change the resolution to match the expected device the user is going to use.


### some positioning schemes
1. **Normal flow** 
> "Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one".

2. **Relative positioning**
> "Relative positioning moves an
element in relation to where it
would have been in normal flow"

3. **Absolute positioning**
> "The box offset properties (top
or bottom and left or right)
specify where the element
should appear in relation to its
containing element."

4. **Fixed positioning**
> "Fixed positioning is a type
of absolute positioning that
requires the position property
to have a value of fixed."


### fixed vs liquid layouts
*** Advantages ***

the fixed: 
- pixel values are accurate.
- more control on the appearance.
- control line lengths.
- same image size always.

the liquid:
- page will fill the entire browser
- fits small windows


***Disadvantages***

the fixed: 
- big gaps on the edges
- pages can look smaller on high-res devices
- font might not fit if increased

the liquid:
- page can look different
- images can overflow elements
- words may squash

### Css framework

ADVANTAGES:
- They save you from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks.
- They will have been tested across different browser versions (which helps avoid browser bugs).

DISADVANTAGES:
- They often require that you
use class names in your
HTML code that only control
the presentation of the page
(rather than describe its
content).
- In order to satisfy a wide
variety of needs, they often
contain more code than you
need for your particular web
page (commonly referred to
as code “bloat”).



## Functions
**what is a function?**

perform a pre-written statements to perform a special task when the function is called.

**The syntax**

![fun.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/cssi-2.3-functions/master/images/functions.png)

>functions can use paramaters or not depend on the user requirements.

**to call a function:**
- Area
> if the function itself doesnt need parameters.
- Area(x,y)
> if the function itself need parameters.

> we use the command return to output the thing we need from the function.

> to return multiple data we collect them into an array and return the array.




## pair programming
two people work together on the same code helps with solving errors and find mistakes alot quicker.

reasons to adopt pair programming:
1. more effective
2. engaging collaborations
3. learning from fellows
4. social skills
5. job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

### things to consider when designing
- screen size: different users use different devices to log in the website so we have to take the devices into consideration.
- screen resolution: the number of dots a screen show per inch.
- page size
