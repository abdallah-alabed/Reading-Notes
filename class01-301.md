## what is a component?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

### component characteristics:
- Reusability: can be reused in different situations.
- Replaceable: components can be easily removed or replaced.
- Not context specific: works in different environments or contexts.
- Extensible: components can be extended to change the behaviour.
- Encapsulated: do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
- Independent: components have minimal dependence on other components.

### advantages of using component based architecture:
- Ease of deployment: easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components. 
- Reduced cost: The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.
- Ease of development.
- Reusable: the use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.
- Modification of technical complexity: A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.
- Reliability: The reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
- System maintenance and evolution: Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
- Independent: Independency and flexible connectivity of components.


## what is props?
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
