## component lifecycle in React
React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events.

#### Life cycle Phases
- Mounting: creating and inserting component into the DOM.
- Updating: Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered.
- Unmounting: The final phase of the lifecycle if called when a component is being removed from the DOM.

the first thing that happen in the lifecycle is creating the constructor.

#### componentDidMount()
This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM,it should go here.

if we want to put the following in sequence:
from the graph

1- constructor

2- render

3- React Updates

4- componentDidMount

5- componentWillUnmount



### State vs Props
- arguments to a function
- for things you pass it as a function

#### What types of things can you pass in the props?
- data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc.

#### What is the big difference between props and state?
- props you pass into a component and handled outside of the component but state is handled inside of that component.

#### When do we re-render our application?
- when we change the state inside the application.

#### What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
- inside of the form to store what the value we add or change.
