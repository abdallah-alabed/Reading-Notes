## Lists
we render lists inside components

steps:

1- create a list item and Loop numbers in 'li' list elements
                                              
2- We include the listItems array inside a 'ul' element, and render it to the ReactDOM.


## Key 
A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.
  
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

> use IDs from your data as keys or item indices(if the order doesnt change)
  
notes about keys:
  
  - Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings.
  
  - if you extract a ListItem component, you should keep the key on the <ListItem /> elements in the array rather than on the <li> element in the ListItem itself.
