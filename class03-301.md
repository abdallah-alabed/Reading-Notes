## Lists
we render lists inside components

steps:

1- create a list item and Loop numbers in 'li' list elements
                                              
2- We include the listItems array inside a 'ul' element, and render it to the ReactDOM.


## Key 
A ‚Äúkey‚Äù is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.
  
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

> use IDs from your data as keys or item indices(if the order doesnt change)
  
notes about keys:
  
  - Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings.
  
  - if you extract a ListItem component, you should keep the key on the <ListItem /> elements in the array rather than on the <li> element in the ListItem itself.
  
 
  
### read03 questions (part 1)
  
- What does .map() return? return a <li> element for each item.
  
- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
  
1- create a list item and Loop numbers in 'li' list elements

- Each list item needs a unique ____. Key.
  
- What is the purpose of a key? Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed
  
  
### Spread Operator
 the use of an ellipsis of three dots (‚Ä¶) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments. (When ...arr is used in the function call, it ‚Äòexpands‚Äô an iterable object arr into the list of arguments.)
  
  
  Example:
  - Math.max(1,3,5) // 5

  - Math.max([1,3,5]) // NaN
  so we need the spread to make the array input into the function to output a single argument.
  
  -Math.max(...[1,3,5]) // 5
  
  
  ** the spread operatot can also do: **
  - Copying an array
  
- Concatenating or combining arrays
  
- Using Math functions
  
- Using an array as arguments
  
- Adding an item to a list
  
- Adding to state in React
  
- Combining objects
  
- Converting NodeList to an array
  


### read03 questions (part 2)
  
  - What is the spread operator? 
  the use of an ellipsis of three dots (‚Ä¶) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.
  
- List 4 things that the spread operator can do. 
 
1- Using an array as arguments
2- Adding an item to a list
3- Adding to state in React
4- Combining objects
  
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
  
  arr1=[1,2,3]
  arr2=[7,8,9]
  arrTotal=[...arr1,...arr2] // [1,2,3,7,8,9]
  
- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
  
  const new = ['abd','mohammad']
const name = ['omar', 'zaid', ...new]
  
  
  
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
  
const objectOne = {hello: "ü§™"}
const objectTwo = {world: "üêª"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo}
  
  
  ## Passing functions between components
 
  ### read03 questions (part 3)
  
  - In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components? 
  
  create the function where ever the state is

  - In your own words, what does the increment function do? 
  
  loop the array, find the matching name and increment the count

  - How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component? 

  this.props.function(what i want to send back 'name., age, etc..') inside the function itself (it exists in the parent)
  
  -How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component ?
  
  now pressing the button will call the function , it will change the state so it will update the counter.
