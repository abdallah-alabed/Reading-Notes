## Forms
- the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input.
- In React, a <textarea> uses a value attribute instead. 
- instead of select attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag.
- In React, an <input type="file" /> is always an uncontrolled component because its value can only be set by a user, and not programmatically. You should use the File API to interact with the files.
  
  
  
- What is a ‘Controlled Component’? 
  maintain their own state and update it based on user input.
  
- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form 
  OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
  Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.
  
- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? 
  you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.

  
  
## Conditional Operator
  we can shortcut the conditional statements with arrow functions
  
  ex: 
  - Arrow : person.driver = person.age >=16 ? 'Yes' : 'No';
  - Normal : if (person.age >= 16) {
             person.driver = 'Yes';
             } else {
             person.driver = 'No';
             }
  
  
  ** we can create two conditions in one**
  
  let price = isStudent ? 8 : isSenior ? 6 : 10


  
  
  Why would we use a ternary operator? to execute block of code if a certain condition is met.
  
  if(x===y){ console.log(true);  }
  
  else { console.log(false);  }

lets rewrite it with ternary statement:  let quest = x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false) ;
