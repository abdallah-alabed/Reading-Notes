## Thinking in React

1- How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.

use single responsibility principle ( a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.)

2- Build A Static Version in React

is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity.
> don’t use state at all to build this static version.

***Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?***

- you’ll want to build components that reuse other components.
- pass data using props.
- you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model.


3-  Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

***three questions about each piece of data:***

- Is it passed in from a parent via props?
- Does it remain unchanged over time?
- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?

4- Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live

***How can you identify where state needs to live?***
- Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
- Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
- Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
- If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state
and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

5- Add Inverse Data Flow
