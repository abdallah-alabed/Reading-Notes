# pain in growth
- growth doesnt come easy! it comes with pain both mentally and pphysically but to hold on we need to 
find the common thread that makes the pain worthwhile, that puts the pain into perspective. 
Youâ€™re here because you chose to invest in a different life. A better life.

# Big O notation 
is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

- O(1)

an algorithm that will always execute in the same time regardless of the size of the input data set.

- O(N)

an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

- O(N<sup>2</sup>)

an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

- O(2^N)

an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

- O(log N)

described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase
