# Stacks and Queues

# Stacks
a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

- Push: Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- Pop: Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. 
- Top: This is the top of the stack.
- Peek: When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack.
- IsEmpty: returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## some concepts:
- FILO
> First In Last Out
> 
This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

- LIFO
> Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

# Queue

Enqueue: Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
Dequeue: Nodes or items that are removed from the queue.
Front: This is the front/first Node of the queue.
Rear: This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
Peek: When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. 
IsEmpty: returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

## some concepts:
- FIFO
> First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

- LILO
> Last In Last Out

This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
