# Pandas
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use data analysis library built on top of NumPy and provides features not available in it. 

## panda vs numpy
difference between pandas and NumPy: NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column.

## three main data structures in pandas:
- Series — 1D
- DataFrame — 2D
- Panel — 3D
