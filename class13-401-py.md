# Linear Regression
you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn.

## what is Scikit-learn?
it is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

## imports
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. spicy.stats
4. matplotlib.pyplot
5. sklearn

## functions
1. lm.fit() -> fits a linear model
2. lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
3. lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.

## prediction
- y: the variable we are predicting!
- x: the variable we use to predict!

**Prediction steps**
1. plot the data
2. x and y on axis
3. draw a line that represents the points relation
