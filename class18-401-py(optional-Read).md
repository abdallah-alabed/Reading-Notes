# Cryptography

> The word Cryptography comes from the roots 'crypto' and 'graphy'

- **Encryption**: The process of hiding the text either by switching letter , deleting letters or transform them into something else

- **Decryption**: the process of turning back the encrypted text to a normal one.

Types of Cryptography
1. Hashing: changes a message into an unreadable string of text for the purpose of verifying the messageâ€™s contents, not hiding the message itself.
2. Symmetric Cryptography: uses a single key to encrypt a message and then decrypt that message upon delivery.
3. Asymmetric Cryptography: uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography.
4. Key Exchange Algorithms: A key exchange algorithm, like Diffie-Hellman, is used to safely exchange encryption keys with an unknown party.

Types of Cryptographic Functions
1. Authentication
2. Nonrepudiation
3. Confidentiality
4. Integrity
