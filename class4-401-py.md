# Recursive Functions in Python
 A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.
 
 **Maintaining State**:
 - Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
 - Keep the state in global scope

**Recursive Data Structures in Python**

A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself. A list is an example of a recursive data structure.

# Classes and Objects
- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity.
Objects get their variables and functions from classes. 
- Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

**Accessing Objects**:

we access objects using dot notation (object.key)
