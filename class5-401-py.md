## Big O(oh) notation
is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. 
- Running Time
- Memory Space

depends on 4 factors:
- Input Size
- Units of Measurement
- Orders of Growth
- Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

## linked lists
a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

**Singly** - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

**Doubly** - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

**Traversal** - When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing
